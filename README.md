# Ignore-and-Blocked
This is a Rust (video game) plugin that allows for the use of blocked people as well as ignored players. This plugin was made by using the plugin made by [MisterPixie at uMod](https://umod.org/plugins/ignore) and adding to it. As such, it's not really my creation, but my modification of an already existing code. Please support [MisterPixie](https://umod.org/user/MisterPixie) if you do like this plugin.

This plugin was made in a way that uploaded the ORIGINAL code first, and then edited it so you can compare and see any changes I had made. If you don't trust its the original code, do exactly the same thing, go get the orignal code from [MisterPixie at uMod](https://umod.org/plugins/ignore) and upload to a private GitHub repository, then edit the code you put in with my code, and you can see what has changed.

This can be used in tandem with the [NTeleportaion modication](https://github.com/ViolationHandler-exe/NTeleportation-Blocking). This will allow you to block users and NOT allow them to teleport to you.
